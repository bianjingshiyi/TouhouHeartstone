      Font License,

      SIL
      OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007

      -----------------------------------------------------------


      PREAMBLE

      The
      goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide

      development
      of collaborative font projects, to support the font

      creation efforts
      of academic and linguistic communities, and to

      provide a free and open
      framework in which fonts may be shared and

      improved in partnership with
      others.


      The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified
      and

      redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves.
      The

      fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,

      redistributed
      and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved

      names are not
      used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,

      however, cannot
      be released under any other type of license. The

      requirement for fonts
      to remain under this license does not apply to

      any document created
      using the fonts or their derivatives.


      DEFINITIONS

      "Font Software"
      refers to the set of files released by the Copyright

      Holder(s) under
      this license and clearly marked as such. This may

      include source files,
      build scripts and documentation.


      "Reserved Font Name" refers to any
      names specified as such after the

      copyright statement(s).


      "Original
      Version" refers to the collection of Font Software

      components as distributed
      by the Copyright Holder(s).


      "Modified Version" refers to any derivative
      made by adding to,

      deleting, or substituting -- in part or in whole
      -- any of the

      components of the Original Version, by changing formats
      or by porting

      the Font Software to a new environment.


      "Author"
      refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical

      writer or other
      person who contributed to the Font Software.


      PERMISSION & CONDITIONS

      Permission
      is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining

      a copy of
      the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed,

      modify, redistribute,
      and sell modified and unmodified copies of the

      Font Software, subject
      to the following conditions:


      1) Neither the Font Software nor any of
      its individual components, in

      Original or Modified Versions, may be
      sold by itself.


      2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software
      may be bundled,

      redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided
      that each copy

      contains the above copyright notice and this license.
      These can be

      included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable
      headers or

      in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within
      text or

      binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by
      the user.


      3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved
      Font

      Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the

      corresponding
      Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the

      primary font
      name as presented to the users.


      4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s)
      or the Author(s) of the Font

      Software shall not be used to promote,
      endorse or advertise any

      Modified Version, except to acknowledge the
      contribution(s) of the

      Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with
      their explicit written

      permission.


      5) The Font Software, modified
      or unmodified, in part or in whole,

      must be distributed entirely under
      this license, and must not be

      distributed under any other license. The
      requirement for fonts to

      remain under this license does not apply to
      any document created using

      the Font Software.


      TERMINATION

      This
      license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are

      not
      met.
